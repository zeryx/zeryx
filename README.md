### Hi there 👋 I'm James Sutton (zeryx)
Interested in some neat open source projects I've worked on? Here's a few of them:

For work:
* [OpenForecast](https://github.com/algorithmia-algorithms/OpenForecast) - a powerful multivariate timeseries forecasting model with pytorch
* [Video Stream Processing with ML](https://github.com/algorithmia-algorithms/ml-video-streaming) - a powerful and reliable system to process live streams with image based ML models.
* [Algorithmia CI/CD github action](https://github.com/marketplace/actions/algorithmia-ci-cd) - a mechanism to enable CI/CD infrastructure for ML workflows on the Algorithmia platform.

For fun:
* [Tweet your own Adventure](https://github.com/zeryx/tweet-your-own-adventure) - A simple workflow to generate "choose your own adventure" stories on Twitter.
* [ShyftWrk](https://github.com/zeryx/ShyftWrkQT) - A now pretty dated C++/Qt project for helping to visualize shiftworker synergy
